    # Welcome to Flowriter

    This notebook is just a folder of plain markdown files in your Documents folder. Any app can open them, and nothing is locked in.

    ## Writing

    Markdown renders as you type. The syntax shows on the line you're editing and gets out of the way everywhere else: **bold**, _italic_, `code`, [links](https://github.com/jonnilundy/flowriter).

    - Lists continue when you press Return
    - [ ] Checkboxes too
    - [x] Click one to tick it

    ## Moving around

    - **⌘K** runs any command. **⌘O** jumps to a note by name.
    - **⌘⇧F** searches inside all your notes.
    - **⌘N** creates a note. **⌘T** opens a new tab.
    - **⌘\\\\** shows or hides the sidebar.
    - Type `[[` to link to another note, like [[Welcome]].

    ## Daily notes

    **⌘⇧D** jumps to today's entry in your daily note, adding a dated heading if it isn't there yet.

    ## Headings fold

    Hover a heading and click the arrow on its left to collapse everything under it. **⌘⌥←** collapses all headings and **⌘⌥→** expands them.

    ## Images, tables, math and diagrams

    Paste or drop an image: it's saved in an `attachments` folder next to the note. Hover it and drag the corner handle to resize, or right-click for preset sizes.

    | Feature | Shortcut |
    | --- | --- |
    | Command palette | ⌘K |
    | Search all notes | ⌘⇧F |

    Math uses LaTeX: $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$

      Idea --> Draft --> Done
    ```

    ## Make it yours

    **⌘,** opens Settings: themes, fonts, sizes and spacing. **⌘+** and **⌘−** change the text size.

    Delete this note whenever you like. Happy writing.
